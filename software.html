                    <p>Kanji UP! is an application that helps you learn to recall and write 2042 Japanese Kanji characters.  It currently supports the Heisig ordering (currently up to Vol 5) and method of study focusing on recall of the kanji based on meaning.</p>
                    <p>Features:</p>
                    <p>Study Mode:<br/>
                      <ul><li>Study Kanji by practicing them one by one.</li>
                        <li>Information displayed: meaning, strokes, readings.</li>
                        <li>You can enter a short story to help you remember them.</li>
                        <li>You can practice drawing the Kanji with the option to trace over an underlay of the correct Kanji.</li>
                      </ul></p>

                        <li>You are given an area to write your answer down, and can then compare your answer with the correct answer.</li>
                        <li>After answering, you can practice writing the Kanji to re-inforce the correct writing in case of mistakes. </li>
                      </ul></p>  
                    <p>Scheduled Test Mode:<br/>
                      <ul><li>When enabled, the application will automatically schedule quizzes for you based on past performance.</li>
                        <li>Based on proven spaced-repetition algorithms which schedules problemmatic sooner, to make the most efficient use of your time, and to keep your knowledge retention high.</li>
                      </ul></p>
                    <p>Study Reminders:<br/>
                      <ul><li>You can have the app remind you when it's time to study.  Never again forget to do some practice drills each day!</li></ul></p>
                    <p>Starred List:</br>
                      <ul><li>Add problematic Kanji to your starred list for later review with the tap of the star symbol.</li></ul></p>
                    <p>Stroke Orders:</br>
                      <ul><li>At any time a Kanji is displayed, you can tap on it to see stroke order animations.  Three speeds of animation are available under Settings.</li></ul></p>
                    <p>The latest version is 2.23.  It used to be published on the Play Store, but it wasn't worth updating the listing all the time Google changed their policies, so I took the app down and made it freely available here.</p></td></tr>

      <td id="col2"><p><a name="cardflasher"></a><h1>CardFlasher</h1></p>
	    <p>CardFlasher is a program that aims to teach foreign language such as Japanese via the use of electronic flashcards.  A small flashcard appears at the bottom-right of the screen at user-defined intervals.  On this card a symbol/character/word is displayed and a text field requests the user enter the equivalent character/word for the displayed symbol.  If the user repeatedly fails certain cards, then those card will be displayed more frequently.</p>
	    <p>I wrote this freeware program in order to learn the Japanese syllabileries <i>Hiragana</i> and <i>Katakana</i> (collectively known as <i>Kana</i>), as well as <i>Kanji</i> (the large number of symbols that the Japanese inherited from China).  However, this program is completely configurable and can be used to teach the Greek alphabet for example.</p>
	    <p><ul>
	      <li>For MS Windows <u>NT/2000/XP</u>, you should simply enable East Asian language support via the control panel regional settings.</li>
		  <li>For MS Windows <u>95/98/Me</u>, you can add enable East Asian language support by installing <a HREF="software/cardflasher/JpnSupp.exe">this</a> file from Microsoft.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>The application proved to be quite popular and I had people contacting me to let me know that entire classrooms at their school were using it.  I was also approached by a publishing company in Japan, but we never ended up coming to any deal sadly.</p>
		<p>The latest version of CardFlasher is 0.99beta.  Please note that this is now unsupported software, but if I get enough requests I might consider dusting it off.</p></td></tr>

	    <p><b>Incarnation 1:</b></p>
        <p>LingoLessons was effectively an evolution of the ideas I had for CardFlasher, but extended to the web and a whole host of platforms.  You could create and share your own lessons with other internet users.  I built the first first version of the site in 2004, and spent quite some time building it up, but ultimately the ideas grew to big for me to manage with a day job, so I had to put it to suspend the project.</p>
		<p>Here are some screenshots below of the various versions I wrote.  Essentially you could start study on one client, and continue where you left on another client.  In addition to these I wrote a Java MIDP version as well as a Windows Mobile version.  I just love writing things for different application platforms!</p>

		<p><b>Incarnation 2:</b></p>
        <p>In 2006 I then decided to develop and release a shareware version of a more advanced version of CardFlasher, still using the LingoLessons name.  It was reasonably popular, but piracy was a very big issue.  After just 5 registrations, my app found it's way on a huge number of pirate websites, and I saw people on sharing sites trading it between each other.  It wasn't the sort of thing you like to see after all the effort.  So I went down the path of adding various anti-piracy measures, but this took time and money.  Regarding the latter I had to increase the price of the app to cover the costs of the tools I needed to stop the piracy, but by then I had become quite demotivated and sales reduced to a small trickle, so I decided to stop selling it and just support any queries from existing customers.  There were some good lessons learnt (excuse the pun) in the process.</p>
		<p>Below is a screenshot of the latest version of LingoLessons in action.  As you can see, I took the idea back to it's roots and made it a method of study you perform while you are doing something else.  The rationale is that people often just don't have time to sit down in front of a computer to study, but while they are surfing, or checking their email, my app can be testing you without you feeling like you're being tested.</p>

		<p><b>Incarnation 3?</b></p>
		<p>I'm currently taking what I have learnt from the above experiences and developing in incarnation that takes the strengths of each idea.  Watch this space.</p>
