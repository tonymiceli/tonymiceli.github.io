        <p>LingoLessons was effectively an evolution of the ideas I had for CardFlasher, but extended to the web and a whole host of platforms.  You could create and share your own lessons with other internet users.  I built the first first version of the site in 2004, and spent quite some time building it up, but ultimately the ideas grew to big for me to manage with a day job, so I had to put it to suspend the project.</p>
		<p>Here are some screenshots below of the various versions I wrote.  Essentially you could start study on one client, and continue where you left on another client.  In addition to these I wrote a Java MIDP version as well as a Windows Mobile version.  I just love writing things for different application platforms!</p>

        <p>In 2006 I then decided to develop and release a shareware version of a more advanced version of CardFlasher, still using the LingoLessons name.  It was reasonably popular, but piracy was a very big issue.  After just 5 registrations, my app found it's way on a huge number of pirate websites, and I saw people on sharing sites trading it between each other.  It wasn't the sort of thing you like to see after all the effort.  So I went down the path of adding various anti-piracy measures, but this took time and money.  Regarding the latter I had to increase the price of the app to cover the costs of the tools I needed to stop the piracy, but by then I had become quite demotivated and sales reduced to a small trickle, so I decided to stop selling it and just support any queries from existing customers.  There were some good lessons learnt (excuse the pun) in the process.</p>
		<p>Below is a screenshot of the latest version of LingoLessons in action.  As you can see, I took the idea back to it's roots and made it a method of study you perform while you are doing something else.  The rationale is that people often just don't have time to sit down in front of a computer to study, but while they are surfing, or checking their email, my app can be testing you without you feeling like you're being tested.</p>

		<p>I'm currently taking what I have learnt from the above experiences and developing in incarnation that takes the strengths of each idea.  Watch this space.</p>
