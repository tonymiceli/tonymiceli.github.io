	  <p>Welcome.</p>
      <p>On this page you will find all sorts of code I have written on various machines over the years, like the Commodore 64 (If I can salvage my old disks!), Commodore Amiga, MS DOS, MS Windows, and the web.</p>
      <p>This also serves as an experiment in setting up my own Linux-based server on a low spec VPS.  This site is currently running on a dual core VPS with just 128MB of RAM.  Currently only approx 25MB of RAM is used on the server.</p>
	  <p>Note that this site isn't supposed to look fancy, just be functional.  I'm not a graphic designer :)  I'll have a shot at improving it after I have finished adding all the content I want.</p>
